#### Pandle.net
Pandle.net is a collection for playing and learning how to write code. It is a part of [Pandle.org](https://www.pandle.org/) and you can contribute by a GitHub pull request!

This is a website powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [leonids theme](https://github.com/bilardi/leonids) on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pandle/net): it only works thanks to GitHub servers and DNS provider.

You can test your contribute on your local by jekyll or docker (see [gist](https://gist.github.com/bilardi/6b6cdcfabed5e5976ba697544be714d6) guide for using docker on your local).
