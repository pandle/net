Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, and Four in a Line) is a two-player game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping their colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically-suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The object of the game is to connect four of one&#8217;s own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before one&#8217;s opponent can do so. There are many variations on the board size, the most commonly used being 7×6, followed by 8×7, 9×7, and 10×7.

The game was first sold under the famous Connect Four trademark by Milton Bradley in February 1974.
