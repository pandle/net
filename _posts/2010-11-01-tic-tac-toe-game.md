Tic-tac-toe, also spelled tick tack toe, or noughts and crosses as it is known in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, is a pencil-and-paper game for two players, O and X, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid, usually X going first. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

The first known video game, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses, 1947) for the EDSAC computer played perfect games of tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.
