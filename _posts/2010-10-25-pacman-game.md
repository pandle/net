The developer of the classic Pacman arcade game is Namco. The designer is Toru Iwatani, and Hideyuki Mokajima San is the programmer. Toshio Kai is responsible for the sound and music. The release dates for the game were 1979, 1980, 1991, 1999, 2005, and again in 2006. It is a maze game for up to two players who take alternating turns. The game was licensed by Midway for distribution in the United states. It was first released in Japan. The game immediately became popular and still is today. The game inspired an animated television serious and a Top 40 Pop song. Pac Man was a good change from the space invaders games that seemed to be about the only choice people had until Pac Man was released.
